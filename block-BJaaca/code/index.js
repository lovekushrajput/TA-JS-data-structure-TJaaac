//  Follow instructions below and write code accordingly.

//  - Create a variable named `character` using `let` assign a value of empty object.
 
let character = {}

//  - Go to this [Arya Stark](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark)

//  Re-assign the value of `character` variable to and object with the key `characterName` and value of "Arya"

character.characterName = "Arya"
'Arya'


// - A variable named `age` is predefined with value 20. Add a new key named `character-age` with the value of `age` variable i.e 20 (don't use the value 20)

let age = 20;
character["character-age"] = age;
20

// - Add a new key `sur name` with the value of the surname of the character i.e "Stark". (Don't remove the space between `sur` and `name`)

 character ["surname"] = "Stark"
 'Stark'

// - Add a new key `title` with the value title of the character i.e "Lady of Winterfell"

character.title =  "Lady of Winterfell";
'Lady of Winterfell'

// - Add another property named `greet` and value should be a function when called should alert `I am [NAME HERE] and my title is [TITLE HERE]`.

character.greet = function (){
    alert(`I am ${character.characterName } and my title is ${character.title}`);
}
undefined



// - Add a new property to the character object named `isFemale` and value will be `true`

character.isFemale = "true"
'true'

// - Execute the function stored in the greet key of the character object

character.greet
undefined

//  - Change the method `greet` to now alert `She is [NAME HERE] and her title is [TITLE HERE]`.

character.greet = alert(`She is ${character.characterName }  and her title is ${character.title}`)
undefined

// - Check by calling `greet` and see if the message changed or not.

character.greet
undefined

//  - Add a new property in the character object `isAdult`. The value will be true if age is greater than 18 or it will be false.

character.isAdult = character["character-age"] >18? true:false;

// - Add a new method (function inside objects are called methods) named `changeIsAdult`. When called should be able to flip the value of `isAdult` from true to false and false to true.

character.isAdult = function (){character["character-age"] >18? true:false}

// - Add a new key with the name stored in variable `keyName` defined below i.e `playedBy` (use [] for computed property) and the value of "Maisie Williams"

character ["keyName"] = "Maisie Williams"
let keyName = 'playedBy';

// - Using `alert` alert the value stored in key you added above `keyName` use the variable name to access

alert(character["keyName"] )

// - Using the function `console.log` log the value of the key `42`. You don't have to add the key

console.log("42")

// - Add a new key named `totalSeasons` with the value of `1 + 2 + 3 + 2`. Use this expression

character.totalseasons = "1 + 2 + 3 + 2"

// - Access the value of the key `totalSeason` (it should be 8)

character.totalseasons = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2
